I compiled my code using GCC compiler

To make the code work, you have to either install the .exe file in this repo or compile the file yourself using the tools you prefer.

The code is basically a Data manager, with 4 different thing you can do, add students, delete them, update their data or get their data.

The only issue is that the code don't have a merge sort because I just found out that 12PM is not midnight but midday so I'm already late, sorry for that...
